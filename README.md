# 📊 Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes

This repository contains the implementation and theoretical analysis of a **Sentiment Analysis** model using the **Naïve Bayes Classifier**, conducted as part of an academic project at **IIT Guwahati** (Sept 2021 – Nov 2021).

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: To classify sentiments (positive/negative) of 2500+ tweets using a Naïve Bayes classifier implemented with Python and NLTK.
- **Focus**: Detailed understanding of the probabilistic theory behind Naïve Bayes, along with practical optimizations such as log-likelihood and Laplace smoothing.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Bayes’ Theorem
Used to compute posterior probabilities from prior knowledge and likelihoods.

### 🔹 Assumptions
- Bag-of-words model
- Conditional independence of features
- Simplified probabilistic modeling for efficient computation

### 🔹 Optimizations
- **Laplace Smoothing** to handle unseen words
- **Log-likelihood** to improve numerical stability
- **Binary Multinomial Model** to emphasize presence over frequency


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.8+**
- **NLTK**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Results

- Achieved **accurate sentiment classification** on test tweets using the probabilistic model.
- Demonstrated the impact of log transformation and Laplace smoothing on model performance.
